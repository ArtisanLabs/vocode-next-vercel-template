## Introduction

This is a hybrid Next.js + Python application that uses Next.js for the frontend and FastAPI for the API backend. It is designed to build Voice AI applications with Vocode and Next.js. The backend is powered by FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. This setup allows you to write Next.js apps that use Python AI libraries on the backend, providing a powerful tool for AI application development.

## Features

- Local Development: This template is configured to work seamlessly in a local environment, using Python as backend FastAPI.
- FastAPI Integration: The template establishes a connection between the Next.js frontend and the FastAPI Python backend.
- Vercel Deployment: While Vercel does not currently support WebSocket, this template can still be deployed on Vercel as a frontend application.

## How It Works

The Python/FastAPI server is integrated into the Next.js app under the `/api/` route.

This is achieved using `next.config.js` rewrites to map any request to `/api/:path*` to the FastAPI API, which is hosted in the `/api` folder.

On localhost, the rewrite will be made to the `127.0.0.1:8000` port, which is where the FastAPI server is running.

In production, the FastAPI server is hosted as Python serverless functions on Vercel.

The FastAPI backend uses the Vocode library to connect to AI providers like Text-to-Speech (TTS), Speech-to-Text (STT), and Language Model (LLM) via websockets. This allows for real-time, efficient communication between the application and the AI services, enabling the development of robust, interactive Voice AI applications.
